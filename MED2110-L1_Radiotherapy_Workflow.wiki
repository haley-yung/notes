What is tumor
- Abnormal growth of tissues

What is benign
- Non cancerous tumour which will not spread to nearby tissues

Difference with malignant and non-malignant disease
- Maligant tumor will spread to other regions of the body rapidly which is harmful to the body

Difference between different treatment methods (Effectiveness, Safety, Treatment Time)
- Brachytherapy 
- -> Highly localized dose and very precise
- -> Very precise and localized therefore reduce damange done to healthy tissues
- -> Shorter treatment time (1 Week) compared to teletherapy

- Teletherapy (External Beam)
- -> Can deliver dosage to most parts of our body
- -> Has to penetrate through healthy tissues, causing side effects
- -> Longer treatment time, has to space out treatment time and dosage in order to reduce damage to issues

- Chemotherapy 
- -> Circulate around the body -> Effective in treating cancers that will spread
- -> Wide range of side effect as it will circulate the whole body

Why do we need superficial RT
- As it can can treat wide range of cancers 

Types of radiation delivery
- Brachytherapy
- Teletherapy
- Internal Adminstration

What is the problem of invasive treatment techniques
- Access to body
- Incisions (causing wounds on the body)
- Increase healing time, pain and risk of infection

What is tomotherapy 
- Another way to deliver radiation therapy, through helical and spiral radiation pattern around the patient
- Can perform CT Scan before treatment to ensure precision
- Can use a high dose while minimizing the side effects to healthy tissues

What is cobalt machine
- Uses a radiactive source to create gamma rays

What is cyber knife and how is it better than the linear accelerator
- It is a linear accelerator mounted on a robot arm allowing more movement angles plus more precision (LA is isocentric and only 1 angle)
- It is used to treat cancer in sensitive areas such as the brain and spinal cord
- More accurate

What can the cyber knife do due to its characteristics
- It can be used to treat sensitive areas due to its accuracy
- It is used to treat the brain as it is much accurate than a linear accelerator

Why do we need Brachytherapy when there is Teletherapy
- As brachytherapy is directly inserting a radioactive substance inside a patient's body
- This allows a more localized and precise radiation dose and does not have to penetrate through healthy body tissues

What is internal administration
- By eating radioactive sources and allow it to circulate around the body
- Effective in treating tumors that will spread
- However, will have wide range of side effects as it circulates around the body

List a safety precaution for brachytherapy and internal administration
- Radioactive substance is put into a safe
- Radioactive substance for brachytherapy is inserted to the body of the patient with a machine instead of hand

List staffs in a RT department
- Nurses
- Medical Physicist
- Radiotherapist
- Engineers

What is the difference of engineers and physicists
- Physicists is for quality assurance
- Engineers is for maintaining the machines

What is the consultation process and why is it important
- Current situation of the cancer and treatment methods are explained to the patients 
- Explain side effects
- To acquire consent 

What is informed consent and why is it important
- Medical Professionals will offer information about treatment options, risk and side effects to the patient
- Allow patient to have a better understanding of the current situation
- Create trust between patient and doctor
- Protect medical professionals from law suits

What is the purpose of simulation
- Simulate treatment process
- To obtain required data from CT Scans to facilitate planning
- Immobilization for the treatment proccess

Why do we need to have a planning stage
- As every paitent will have a unique seperate plan
- It is important to have a tailor made plan to treat the tumor while avoiding organs at risk

Why do we need to have Quality Assurance
- This is done before the treatment stage
- This ensures the machine is outputting the required amount of dosage

Why do we need to have a Weekly Review
- To follow up on treatment 
- See if there is extra side effects
