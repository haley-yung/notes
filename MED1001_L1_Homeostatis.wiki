What is homeostasis
- To maintain a stable internal environment despite of the constant changing external environment

How does an organism survive in a constantly changing environment.  
- By detecting and responding to changes from the external environment. 
- Returning the deviations in physiological values to optimal ones

Why is homeostasis a dynamic process
- As the body is constantly detecting and responding to changes

Examples of physiological set points
- Temperature
- Blood glucose level

What happens if the physiological values/setpoints are not maintained
- Become sick

What is a homeostatic control system
- Contains receptor effector control center(the brain)
- A system that maintains homeostasis
- Receptor passes signal of change to the brain
- The control center will then determine an optimal physiological set point 
- The effector will then perform the change as instructed by the brain 

Examples of input signal(receptor), output singal(effector)

What does the receptor do after it recieves a signal
- Detects changes and sends the signal to the brain

What does the control center do with the signal
- It analzyes and determines an optimal setpoint and instructs the effector to perform the change

How does the constriction of skin and blood vessel decrease the heat loss from body
- Vasodilation -> Increase lumen -> Increase blood flow -> Increase heat loss 
- Vasoconstriction -> Decrease lumen 
- Blood will carry heat -> Heat will be loss to the surface(skin)

What is the purpose of feedback loops
- To control physiological processes

What does a positive feedback system do
- Enhances the production of the product

Example of positive feedback system
- When the head of the fetus reaches the cervix, a hormone will be released to push the festus

What does a negative feedback system do, how does it respond the change
- Inhibits the change, by returning the deviated physiological value to an optimal setpoint

What are afferent pathways
- Afferent pathways 傳入
- To detect stimuli from the outside environment
- Tells the brain what they're sensing

What are efferent pathways
- Efferent pathways 傳出
- To instruct different parts of the body
- Pass signal from the Central Nervus System(brain) to the rest of the body

List a common feature of hormones and neurotransmitters
- Can transmit signals

Differences with hormones and neurotransmitters
1)Origin 
- Horomones -> Endocrine glands to bloodstream to target destination
- Neurotransmitters -> nervous system
2)Speed
- Hormones -> Slower as they have to propagate in the blood
- Neurotransmitter -> High speed

What are glands 
- It secretes chemical substances

Endocrine vs Exocrine
- Endocrine secretes chemical substances into the bloodstream or tissue directly(hormones)
- Exocrine releases chemical substances into ducts or the surface 

What is the purpose of hormones
- To instruct a target organ/tissue to perform something

What is the purpose of neurotransmitters
- To transmit signals

What is the purpose of enzymes
- Speed up and assist chemical activities to occur in our body

What is adaptation, examples
- Characteristics that favor survival

What is acclimatization, examples 
- Improved function of an existing homeostatic system

Which one is reversible
- Acclimatization

Why does people born in mountains have higher RBC count
- As there is less amount of oxygen in high altitude, the body will produce more RBC to increase the breathing rate

What is biological rhythm, examples
- Natural cycle in our body to affect out body

What does biological rhythm do to the homeostatic control system
- It adds an anticipatory component to the homeostatic control system

How does adding an anticipatory component affect the homeostatic control system
- The homeostatic control system can work without detecting a signal first(detector)
- The system can carry out responses just before the stimulus/change occurs
