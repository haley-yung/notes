* What is DRR

* What is the purpose of simulation

* What is body contour and why is it important

* Main benefit of CT over Conventional Simulator

* Why is geometric accuracy/information important

* Why is simulation important

* Why is it important to assess the patient's condition

* Why do patients have to raise both their hands when treatment

* What is fluorscopy

* What is the difference of simulator and linear accelerator in terms of energy

* Why does kV produce clearer images than mV

* List a use case for prone treatment and its benefits

* What are the priorities during immobilization

* Why should we consider whether if the patient is uncomfortable
 
* Types of errors
