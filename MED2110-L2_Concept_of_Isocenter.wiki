## L2 Concept of Isocenter ##

* Verification vs Validation
- verification -> ensure meets criteria/requirements
- validation -> ensure device/plan is working as planned

* CT vs X ray
- CT is 3D while X ray is 2D
- CT Scan are good at providing detailed quality imaging for bones, organs and tumor, can check internal organ injuries 
- X ray excels in detecting bony structures. But fails to diagnose problems with muscle, tissue, organ

* CT vs MRI
- MRI does not use radiation, is less harmful. Excels in showing joints, soft tissues, muscles

* CT vs DRR
- CT is in 3D which provides a volumetric information about the patient
- CT is very flexible as it can generate 2D radiographs at different angles including beam angle and different planes (anterior, posterior)  

* List one cons of using CT
- As CT is in 3D, it is hard for staff to use it to verification

* List one benefit of using CT
- It is flexible 
 
* Why can CT show bony structure
- 

* What is DRR
- Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph

* What is the purpose of simulation
- To obtain dimensions of the patient, including the volume and location of the tumor and healthy tissues/organs
- To acquire volumetric data of the patient by CT
- Assessing the patient's condition (pain in specific areas?) and create a treatment plan accordingly
- Immobilization devices

* What is body contour and why is it important
- To outline organs to facilitate planning by avoiding them

* Main benefit of CT over Conventional Simulator
- CT has volumetric information and has a more accurate 3D representation. Therefore, it has higher geometric accuracy compared to the Conventional simulator
- Conventional simulators can only achieve 3D images by combining two angles to form a simple 3D image
- Conventioanl simulators are less accurate geometically

* Why is geometric accuracy/information important
- Inaccurate geometric information will lead to not enough/ overdose on the tumor

* Why is simulation important
- To acquire volumetric information and to localize the tumor + healthy tissues
- Which is an essential part in planning as we have to avoid organs at risk
- Gives a clear idea to the patient on what is going on, increasing trust and allows them to cooperate

* Why is it important to assess the patient's condition
- As some patient might be in pain in certain areas
- The patient's comfort has to be considered
- Or else it would not be possible for them to reproduce the treatment plant
- Also would lead to inaccuracy

* Why do patients have to raise both their hands when treatment
- When the patients are treating chest cases, they raise their hands so that radiation dose will not pass through the healthy tissues(their hands)

* What is fluoroscopy
- It is a continuous Xray beam showing continuous changes
- It can see moving targets and tumors

* What is the difference of simulator and linear accelerator in terms of energy
- LA 4MV to 20 MV
- Electron 4MeV - 25 MeV
- Diagnose Xray -> 124eV to 124keV

* kV vs mV imaging
- kV imaging has less dose but higher quality images
 
* Is the result on the Xray film an accurate representation
- No, the theory of the Xray works by the Xray passing through the patient, then to the film which shows the result
- As there is distance between the patient and the film
- The XRay is not accurate due to the magnification factor ( Similar Triangles )

* What is the shape of the table in the CT machine and why
- The table of the CT machine is flat as it allows us to place immobilization accessories on them

* What is virtual simulation and why is it possible
- As we have the volumetric information of the patient by CT 
- We are able to do virtual simulator and planning without the patient

* OARs when treating breast cases
- Heart ( left lung )
- lung
- spinal cord

* Half beam block technique
- Technique used when treating chest
- Can spare organs (heart and lungs) underneathe the chest

* Bird's eye view vs Beam's eye view
- Bird's eye view is top to bottom
- Beam's eye view is the perspective from the beam
- Beam's eye view allows us to perform verfication and QA as the treatment field size/ area is shown

* CT vs MR main difference
- CT can show bony structures and organs 
- MR excels at showing soft tissues, tendons, muscles

* What is the point of immobilization
- Immobilization is to restrict movement of the patient during treatment
- Patient's movement will lead to inaccuracy no matter how good the plan is

* Is there a standard for immobilization
- No, immobilization devices being used is according to the needs of the patient
- As the comfort of the patient is prioritized since their movement will lead to inaccuracy
 
* What is a factor to consider during setups and immobilization
- Whether patient is comfortable
- Reproducibility

* When is suppine and prone used
- Suppine is commonly used
- Prone can be used when treating chest, to reduce movement due to respiration, so that the target tumor in the chest will not be moving

* What is the cons for prone
- It is uncomfortable
 
* List a use case for prone treatment and its benefits
- When treating chest, as respiration will cause tumor to move up and down. Lying in a prone position can prevent the target from moving

* What are the priorities during immobilization
- Patient's condition
- Whether they are comfortable

* Why should we consider whether if the patient is uncomfortable
- As patient's movement will lead to inaccuracy
 
* Types of errors
- Systematic error -> error that occurs due to specific reason -> can be avoided 
- Random error -> error that occurs randomly -> adds inconsistency to the plan

* Differences in setup when comparing head cases and head+neck case
- head case do not contain shoulder mold 
- as more mold will make the patient uncomfortable
 
* Why do we need special arrangements for immobilization devices when treating abdomen and breast cases
- Due to respiration, the target tumor will move up and down

* What are the solutions for the problem mentioned above
- Treating in a prone position or use a breath hold
- A breath hold is when a patient hold their breath for 20 seconds and the dose is delivered in the time frame

* What are the considerations for pallitative cases
- Simple and patient's comfort
- Complex setup are avoided since the patient cannot maintain their position 

* What is isocenter
- Is the point where radiation beams intersect when the gantry rotates
